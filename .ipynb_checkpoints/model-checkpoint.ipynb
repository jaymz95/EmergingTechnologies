    "### `__future__`\n",
    "is a real module, and serves three purposes:\n",
    "- To avoid confusing existing tools that analyze import statements and expect to find the modules theyâ€™re importing. (ref 'https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html')\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Keras`\n",
    "Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. (ref 'https://keras.io')\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sequential\n",
    "-The sequential API allows you to create models layer-by-layer for most problems. It is limited in that it does not allow you to create models that share layers or have multiple inputs or outputs. (ref 'https://machinelearningmastery.com/keras-functional-api-deep-learning/')\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dense\n",
    "-Dense is a name for a Fully connected / linear layer in keras. (ref 'https://forums.fast.ai/t/dense-vs-convolutional-vs-fully-connected-layers/191')\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dropout\n",
    "- Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. (ref 'https://machinelearningmastery.com/dropout-regularization-deep-learning-models-keras/')\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flatten\n",
    "- The purpose of this argument is to preserve weight ordering when switching a model from one data format to another. (ref 'https://keras.io/layers/core/')\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conv2D\n",
    "- This layer creates a combination kernel that is combined with the layer input to produce a tensor of outputs. If 'use_bias' is True, a bias vector is created and added to the outputs. Finally, if activation is not None, it is applied to the outputs as well. (ref 'https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/')\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MaxPooling2D\n",
    "- Max pooling operation for spatial data. (ref 'https://keras.io/layers/pooling/#maxpooling2d') \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Backend (Tensorflow)\n",
    "- keras relies on a specialized, well optimized tensor manipulation library to do so, serving as the \"backend engine\" of Keras. (ref 'https://keras.io/backend/') \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### `MNIST`\n",
    "The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from keras, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. (ref 'http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/')\n"
